This directory contains code for simulators.
Currently we a simulator for the EtherCAT based hardware,
which we have @ ESS.
It is written in C and works on Linux or Mac OS X.
I haven't tested if under Windows for a long time, so it may not
compile here.
If you are interested in running it under Windows on any platform
(CYGWIN, MSYS, MSVC) send a pull request.
