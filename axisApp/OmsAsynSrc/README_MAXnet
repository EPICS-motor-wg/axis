Please note:

- The MAXnet IP-stack is very basic. It doesn't know anything about routing,
  which means, you can only use it from hosts in the same subnet.
  If IP packets get lost, the controller will ignore retransmission requests and
  the connection will not recover. The driver tries to reset the connection in this case.
  It is recommended to operate the controller in a separate network.
- MAXnet cards with firmware versions older than 1.33.4 shouldn't be used
  with the ethernet port. They abort communication, if they detect a tcp packet 
  with checksum 0xffff.
- Input EOS defaults to "\n\r", output EOS defaults to "\n".
  Since this may not fit every combination of firmware version and serial/IP selection,
  it can be set by calling asynOctetSet[In|Out]putEos prior to calling omsMAXnetConfig()

add this to st.cmd if using the ethernet port:
  drvAsynIPPortConfigure("MAXNET","maxnet-ip-address:23",0,0,0)

add this to st.cmd if using the serial port:
  drvAsynSerialPortConfigure("MAXNET","/your/serial/device",0,0,0)
  asynSetOption("MAXNET",0,"baud","115200")
  asynSetOption("MAXNET",0,"bits","8")
  asynSetOption("MAXNET",0,"parity","none")
  asynSetOption("MAXNET",0,"crtscts","Y")

set the input/output EOS based on the MAXnet firmware version:
  
  ### Uncomment one of the following two lines:
  #asynOctetSetInputEos("MAXNET",0,"\n\r")
  #asynOctetSetInputEos("MAXNET",0,"\n")
  asynOctetSetOutputEos("MAXNET",0,"\n")
