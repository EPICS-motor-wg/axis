# The default in EXAMPLE_CONFIG_SITE.local is to build everything in ADSupport, 
# e.g.  GraphicsMagick, HDF5, JPEG, NETCDF, NEXUS, SZIP, TIFF, XML2, and ZLIB.
# Because these are system files we don't define XXX_INCLUDE or XXX_LIB
# To use non-system versions of these libraries change the definitions here or in
#    CONFIG_SITE.local.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH) 
#    CONFIG_SITE.local.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)

# To use external versions (e.g. not in ADSupport) of one or more these libraries uncomment these lines
# If using a system file don't define XXX_INCLUDE or XXX_LIB
# To use external but non-system files then XXX_INCLUDE and XXX_LIB will need to be defined.
# Definitions can be changed here or in
#    CONFIG_SITE.local.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH) 
#    CONFIG_SITE.local.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)
