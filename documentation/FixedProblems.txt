The DLY-STOP problem
  When the motor is stopped, while in the DLY phase, the record may hang,
  when the readback position doesn't change and the record is not processed.
  http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/tech-talk/2015/msg01786.php

  A workaround is needed in each and every driver, one implementation of the suggested
  workaround is here::

  A more generic solution may be nice to have.
  
Synchronization of RBV and VAL at IOC start
  Should be done on startup, but is not always working with
  an asyn motor (when the connection is not yet established,
  and the record is processd the first time)
  This is, what I can see, a bug.
  
Motor stopped when problem reported.
  Some controllers need this to protect HW.
  Some controllers do not want this, as the stop() will make the
  problem go away, which is bad, when the problem needs to be analyzed.
  
  Solution: the driver can disable (or enable) this feature:
  setIntegerParam(pC_->motorFlagsStopOnProblem_, 0);

Motor done, when hitting a limit switch.
  This is not true, when we home against a limit switch,
  or if we go to a limit switch and then back to the home switch.
  Solution:
  setIntegerParam(pC_->motorFlagsHomeOnLs_, 1);
  
Homing when sitting on a limit switch.
  Today:
  When the high limit switch is hit, writing 1 to HOMF does nothing.
  Espcecially recGblFwdLink(pmr) is not called.
  This is a bug in MR, which needs to be fixed.

  Some controllers will do the correct homing, even if a on a limit
  switch, and HOMF and HOMR have the same effect.
  Some controllers need this protection.
  Others not.
  Solution:
  setIntegerParam(pC_->motorFlagsHomeOnLs_, 1);


Encoder readback was crippled to 32 bit.
  See documentation/FeadbackDataflow.ppt
  commit 7a125b9c,
  "Make it possible to use encoder readback > 32 bit"

Motor stops while jogging.
  When the motor stops because of e.g. an internal soft limit,
  the state machine was confused: commit 81bbe334
  "Record recognizes motor stop while jogging"
  
asyn-based simulator, automated test cases
  Partly fixed:
  There is a simulator for the Ethercat based controllers.
  We can run against the simulator or real hardware.
  More test cases needed.
