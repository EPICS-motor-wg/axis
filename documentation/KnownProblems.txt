  MCU Motrion Control Unit

Synchronization at startup.
  When the record is started, the TCP/IP connection may not be established,
  making the RRBV field to jump to 0 and back to the real position later.
  Note: SNS does not use auto-connect at all. When the record is initiated,
  the TCP/IP connection must be establised an working.
  
CNEN hijacked for amplifier on.
  Should at least be documented.
  A better solution is to seperate power on from close loop, rename the
  fields and the functions.
  (Work ongoing)

Not yet started, but seams ready.
  When a new position is commanded, some controllers report ready, but
  haven't even start yet.
  The ready status is relatet to the old movement.
  This is a glitch.
  It has been observed with controllers using mulit-threading, where
  the communication thread is different from the motion thread.
  (This seams to be true for many, if not all, controllers using TCP/IP)
  I don't have a 100% generic solution here.
  The EthercatMC driver uses a waitNumPollsBeforeReady:
  When the motion is comanded, we wait n polls before calling
  setIntegerParam(pC_->motorStatusDone_, 0);

Values read out from the MCU and put into the record.
  "modern controllers" are typically configured with an engineering tool.
  It would be nice to read out the seetings from the controller and put
  them into the record.
  This is currently done with the soft limits in the EthercatMC,
  more to come.
